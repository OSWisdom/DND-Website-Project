<h2><u> House Rules</u></h2>
<body>
    <p><b>Soul Saves</b>: This is a D20 test where the DM asks for a roll with no modifiers</p>
    <p><b>Heroic Inspiration</b>: When you critically miss with a 1, you are granted a point of inspirtation</p>
    <p><b>Inspiration</b>: You may roll the second advantage die after seeing the results of the first.<br>
    You do not need to call the advantage before seeing the results.</p>
    <p><b>Bardic Inspiration</b>: is a reaction that triggers when an ally fails a roll.</p>
    <p><b>Guidance</b>: is a reaction that triggers when an ally fails a roll.</p>
    <P><b>The Help Action</b>: In most instances requires the helper to be proficient in the skill they  are assisting with.</P>
    <p><b>Health Potions</b>A health potion can be used with a bonus action OR, if using a full action, you take the maximum <br>
        possible amount. Feeding a potion to someone else still requires a full action.</p>
    <p><b>Group Initiative(Retired)</b>Add all of the players initiatives together, and all of the monsters initiatives together.<br>
    whichever side has the highest number goes first.</p>
    <p><b>Death Saves(Retired)</b>Any successful death saving throws results in a critical success. Failures only reset on a long rest.</p>
    <p><b>Character Creation(Suggestion)</b>If possible, everyone should have a different main stat.</p>
    <p><b>Character Creation(Suggestion)</b> Twilight Clerics ability to give temp HP is kind of OP</p>
