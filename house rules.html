<h2><u> House Rules</u></h2>
<body>
    <p><b>Cinematic Advantage</b>: Basically: trading in-world fiction and a skill check from players for advantage on their next attack. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>While describing the situation, the DM describes interesting features in the area.</li>
        <li>The player describes how they want to use a feature to get a cinematic advantage.</li>
        <li>
            The DM determines what attribute and skill (or skills) might be used to accomplish the feat and how difficult it is on a scale <br>
            of DC 10 to 20. Tell the player what the DC is and what penalty they face if they fail so they can make an informed choice.
        </li>
        <li>The player rolls the check as part of their move or action.</li>
    </ul>
        <ol><li>On a success, they get advantage on their next attack.</li>
            <br>
            <li>On a failure something bad happens depending on what they tried, often falling prone.</li>
        </ol>

    
    <p><b>Soul Saves</b>: This is a D20 test where the DM asks for a roll with no modifiers</p>
    <p><b>Heroic Inspiration</b>: When you critically miss with a 1, you are granted a point of inspirtation</p>
    <p>
        <b>Inspiration</b>: You may roll the second advantage die after seeing the results of the first.<br>
        You do not need to call the advantage before seeing the results.
    </p>
    <p><b>Bardic Inspiration</b>: is a reaction that triggers when an ally fails a roll.</p>
    <p><b>Guidance</b>: is a reaction that triggers when an ally fails a roll.</p>
    <P><b>The Help Action</b>: In most instances requires the helper to be proficient in the skill they are assisting with.</P>
    <p>
        <b>Health Potions</b>A health potion can be used with a bonus action OR, if using a full action, you take the maximum <br>
        possible amount. Feeding a potion to someone else still requires a full action.
