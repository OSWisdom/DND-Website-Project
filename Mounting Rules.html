<h2><u> Mounting Rules</u></h2>
<body>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>To Mount a creature you must be within 5 ft of it.
            <li>Requires an action.
            <li>Mounting or Dismounting requires HALF your movement speed - If your movement speed is 0 you cannot mount.
            <li>For Large+ mounts - you select one of the positions on the back of the creature for you to occupy.
            <li>Enemies are able to select either you or the mount as the target for their attacks.
            <li>If your mount suffers forced movement - must succeed a DC10 dex saving throw - if you fail, you fall prone within 5ft of the mount
                </ol>
                <br>
                <br>
                The mount is either <b>Controlled</b> or <b>Intelligent/Untrained</b>
                <i>(As a general rule - Intelligent/Untrained creatures will not be controlled by the rider)</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                Intelligent/Untrained mounts have their own initiative <i>(Might be spooked by combat/fire, attempt to flee, attack allies)</i>
                and go where they wish<i>(Might not be where the player wants them to go)</i>
                <br>
                <br>
                Controlled mounts may be told to Dash, Disengage, or Dodge - and act on the turn of the player who mounted it.
                <br>
                <br>
                <i>Note: Find steed allows the Paladin to control them</i>
