<h2><u> House Character Creation Rules</u></h2>
<body>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Suggestions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>It is recommended that everyone play a class with a different main stat.</li>
        <li>Please build a character that wants to go on adventures.</li>
        <li>You can play an evil character, just dont act evil towards your fellow party members</li>
        <p><em> and if you must, try not to undo the partys good works </em>
        <p>
        <li>
            Try to make room  in your backstory for the other characters to have been longtime associates or perhaps relatives so that the group <br>
            feels tight-knit from the start
        </li>
        <li> Let the adventure we're currently running be the most exciting thing that happens to your character.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Starting Stats</h3>
    <h4>Generally, players may choose from 3 diffent arrays:</h4>

        <h3>Flight at level 1</h3> If you are playing a race that gains flight, you instead gain a reaction to cast the spell slowfall until level 5. <br>
        At level 5 this feature is replaced by your original flight. <br>
